Just another repository
Hello! My name is Aaron a.k.a. Buttersauce Boss! As you can probably tell from my nickname I love cooking. I am starting to learn Javascript to see if I would like a career in coding. It's hard I'll admit but I like the challenge and the ability to create things is really cool to me. I hope this adventure pans out well and will work harder to complete my training at Codcedemy.
